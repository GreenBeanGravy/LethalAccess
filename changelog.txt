- Removed "nvdaControllerClient.dll"
- Removed "NVDA.wav" which played when NVDA was not detected when starting Lethal Company.

- Added: Pressing N toggles the playback of a sound that plays at cardinal North every 2 seconds, DISABLED by default.
- Added: Pressing X speaks the direction you are currently facing, followed by the angle.
- Fixed an issue where the custom player footsteps would play while the player wasn't pathfinding.
- The North Sound now plays every 1.5 seconds, and plays a 50% deeper tone when the sound is behind you.
- Add a new config entry, "NorthSoundPlayInterval", in the "Values" section of the Lethal Access config file, which you can find near the bottom of the file. Changing this value changes how frequent the North sound plays.

- Sped up how fast Lethal Access turns your camera towards objects.
- Made the ship land and take off faster! This may cause audio artifacts, but don't worry, your ship is still intact despite the noises!
- Removed the annoying squeaking sound that plays in the ship.

- Added spoken feedback to celestial body notifications, which appear when landing the ship, and explain the planet you are landing on in more detail.
- Added spoken feedback to some extra end-of-round stats.
- Added custom sounds for picking up items, and picking up two-handed items. Two-handed items also notify the player that they are two-handed, and explain how they work.
- Added a custom sound that plays once the player finishes a hold-interaction, namely, the Start Game Lever, and Factory doors.
- Added an audio notification that plays when the player starts Lethal Company with an unsupported screenreader.
- Fixed an issue where pathfinding to an item would incorrectly notify the player twice, once correctly, and once as "reached unknown item"
- Fixed and issue and added an improvement to categories. Added spoken feedback when navigating over an item in a category that is not currently available near you.

6/20/2024
- Fixed an issue (again) causing the game to crash after the player attempted to pathfind under specific circumstances.
- Fixed an issue causing some categories to improperly appear with no items after a refresh.
- Fixed an issue where navigating between items in a category would speak the incorrect name.
- Fixed an issue where manually stopping looking at the current object would speak the incorrect name.
- Fixed an issue where reaching an object after pathfinding would incorrectly say "Reached unknown object".
- Improved the overall performance of the mod (again).
- Added CullFactory, which hides parts of the Factory that the player cannot see.
- Added LoadStone, which reduces hitches when the ship starts to land, and fixes an issue where voice chat is not available while the ship is landing.
- Added Dissonance LagFix, which fixes some hitches with the voice chat service after an issue occurs.
- Added FixRPC Lag, which fixes some issues with the games error and log reporting causing lag.
- Added LCSymphony, which speeds up game load times.

6/16/2024
- Fixed an issue causing the game to crash under seemingly unknown circumstances.
- The LEFT and RIGHT ALT keys (default), now correctly simulate left and right mouse clicks. All items should work as expected!
- Lethal Access now consistently uses the term "Factory" instead of swapping between "Facility" and "Factory"
- Certain categories in the navigation menu are now hidden and unhidden based on the players location. The "Factory" category is only displayed when the player is landed on a moon, excluding the Company Building. The "Company Buidling" category is only shown if the player is landed at the Company Building. Spoken feedback is also provided when the category list changes.
- Fixed some small typos.
- Fixed an issue where the Factory Entrances and Exits would speak the incorrect name.

6/9/2024
- Doors now automatically open when the player is attempting to pathfind through a door. You still may encounter issues if the player gets physically stuck on an open door 3D model, which I will be fixing.
- Adjusted the pathfinder stopping distance from 1.8 meters to 1.5 meters, bringing the player closer to objects to make it easier for them to be picked up more consistently.
- You can now use the Left and Right ALT keys to activate the left click and right click of your currently held item. This can be rebound in the Lethal Access config.
- Increased the performance of some aspects of the mod by moving frequent checks and tasks off of the main game thread.
