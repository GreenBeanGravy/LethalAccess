## Gameplay Guide

1. Use your navigation menu to select available objects and items nearby. Press `P` to pathfind to the selected object/item. Note that pathfinding is not available inside of the ship if the ship hasn't yet landed.

2. Enter and exit the Factory by pathfinding to the "`Factory Entrance`" and "`Factory Exit`" objects in the navigation menu, under the "`Factory`" category.

3. Find and collect items by selecting them with the "`Items`" navigation category, pathfinding to them with "`P`", and picking them up using "`E`" once you arrive. Switch between your inventory slots using "`1 through 4`" on your number row. Items are most commonly found inside of the Factory.

4. Sell items at the Company Building before the quota deadline (default: 3 days). Check your quota progress anytime with "`K`". You can sell items by landing at the "`Company Building`". Once you land at the Company Building: First, grab any items you want to sell, you can carry up to 4 single-handed items, or 3 single-handed items and 1 two-handed item, which are announced when you pick them up. Pathfind to the "`Item Counter`" inside of the "`Company Building`" category, and interact with the counter using `E` while holding an item you want to sell to place your items down to be sold. Once you have filled up the counter (preventing you from placing more items), select the "`Sell Bell`" inside of the same "`Company Building`" category and interact with it. You may need ding the bell a few times, but not too much! The company monster has sensitive ears. You will hear a pop-up and get spoken feedback when items are successfully sold.

5. Use your held items using "`Left Alt`" and "`Right Alt`" for the corresponding "`Left Click`" and "`Right Click`" actions. You can view your currently held items available actions using "`APOSTROPHE`".

`OPTIONAL`: Customize your mod keybinds using the provided config file! You can find the config file inside of "`Lethal Company Directory/BepInEx/config/Green.LethalAccess.cfg`".
